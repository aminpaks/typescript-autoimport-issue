# TypeScript composite project demo
This is a minimal composite sample project to demo how the incremental build, and the auto-import can be achieved at the same time.

1. Clone the project
2. Run `$ yarn install`
3. Run `$ yarn tsc -b app --watch`
4. Open `app/main/Play.tsx`, and try to auto import the `useCards` or `loadConfigs2`.
